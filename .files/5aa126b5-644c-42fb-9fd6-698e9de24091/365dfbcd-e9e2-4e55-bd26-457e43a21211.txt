instructions, such as saving and restoring multiple registers.
• The PIC16F is a very small, efficient microcontroller.
• The C55x provides a number of architectural features to support the arithmetic 
loops that are common on digital signal processing code.
• The C64x organizes instructions into execution packets to enable parallel 
execution.

Books by Jaggar [Jag95], Furber [Fur96], and Sloss et al. [Slo04] describe the ARM 
architecture. The ARM Web site, http://www.arm.com , contains a large number of 
documents describing various  versions of ARM. Information on the PIC16F can be
