What 	requirements 	might 	we	have 	for	our	GPS	moving 	map? 	Here 	is	an	initial 	list:
•		Functionality: 	This	system 	is	designed 	for	highway 	driving 	and	similar 	uses, 	not	nautical 	
or	aviation 	uses	that	require 	more 	specialized 	databases 	and	functions. 	The	system 	
should 	show 	major 	roads 	and	other 	landmarks 	available 	in	standard 	topographic 		
databases.
•		User interface: 	The	screen 	should 	have 	at	least 	400	×	600	pixel 	resolution. 	The	device 	
should 	be	controlled 	by	no	more 	than	three 	buttons. 	A	menu 	system 	should 	pop	up	on	
the	screen 	when 	buttons 	are	pressed 	to	allow 	the	user	to	make 	selections 	to	control 	the	
system.
•		Performance: 	The	map	should 	scroll 	smoothly. 	Upon 	power-up, 	a	display 	should 	take	no	
more 	than	one	second 	to	appear, 	and	the	system 	should 	be	able	to	verify 	its	position 	and	
display 	the	current 	map	within 	15	seconds.
