time frame. It is essential that the performance requirements be identified early 
because they must be carefully measured during implementation to ensure that 
the system works properly.
• Manufacturing cost:  This includes primarily the cost of the hardware 
components. Even if you don’t know exactly how much you can afford to spend 
on system components, you should have some idea of the eventual cost range. 
Cost has a substantial influence on architecture: A machine that is meant to sell 
at $10 most likely has a very different internal structure than a $100 system.
• Power:  Similarly, you may have only a rough idea of how much power the 
system can consume, but a little information can go a long way. Typically, the 
most important decision is whether the machine will be battery powered or 
plugged into the wall. Battery-powered machines must be much more careful 
about how they spend energy.
• Physical size and weight:  You should give some indication of the physical size of
